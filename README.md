Sample project that shows how to use Keycloak in Angular 11 & Ionic 5 App.


## Running keycloak server on local

Before you start you need a keycloak server on your local machine.

You need to download the keycloak from [oficial page](https://www.keycloak.org/downloads).

Extract the zip into whatever the folder you want. Change the directory into keycloak-X.X.X/bin and run this file

```bash
./standalone.sh
```

Once the startup is done, you can access the admin console on this address http://localhost:8080/auth/


## Running App

Before you go through this example, you should have at least a basic understanding of Ionic concepts. You must also already have Ionic installed on your machine.

## Development server

Run `ionic serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8100/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Requirements

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/getting-started#cli)
